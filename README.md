# Introduction :wave:

Hello there!

My name is Daniel and I am a developer as well as a musician involved in the Chicago music scene. I wanted to create a repo to keep track of the many local musical acts in the United States.

I wanted to do this because there's a lot of undiscovered talent and wanted to create a place where people could come to find something new. I personally love finding out about emerging musicians and there really hasn't a centralized place where I could just go to do so.

Until now!
You can go check out [LIST.md](https://github.com/SubSeven57/TheLocalScene/blob/master/LIST.MD) to see the master list. I just started to repo, so there won't be a lot of content. Thankfully, **you** can contribute! Keep reading to learn how. Be sure to also read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SubSeven57/TheLocalScene/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for full requirements!

# What is a "local act?" ðŸ¤”
Every musical act starts out local; you'll find them at your nearest venue or open mic. When I say "local act", I'm talking about musical acts that really haven't gotten a lot of exposure.

Defining when a local music act stops being a "local act" is hard. I don't really wanna use listener metrics to measure that because it gets tricky, and quite frankly, those metrics don't tell us a lot about active engagement.

For the given time I will define a "local act" as a music act that is currently not signed to any majour labels. Acts that are signed to majour labels will not be included in the master list, but instead moved to a separate _proposed_ list called the Hall of Fame list. I just started repo, so this might not happen for a while.

If you have any suggestions as to how further define the line between "local" and "non-local acts", I am more than happy to listen to them!
