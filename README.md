# Introduction

Hello there! :wave:
My name is Daniel and I am a developer as well as a musician involved in the Chicago music scene. I wanted to create a repo to keep track of the many local musical acts in the United States.

I wanted to do this because there's a lot of undiscovered talent and wanted to create a place where people could come to find something refreshing. I personally love finding out about emerging musicians and there really hasn't a centralized place where I could just go to do so.

# What is a "local act?" ðŸ¤”
Every musical act starts out local; you'll find them at your nearest venue or open mic. When I say "local act", I'm talking about musical acts that really haven't gotten a lot of exposure. Defining when a local music act stops being a "local act" is hard. I don't really wanna use listener metrics to measure that because it gets tricky, and quite frankly, those metrics don't tell us a lot about active engagement. For the given time it will be a judgment call as to  what you might consider "local" vs "not local". If you have any suggestions as to how this can be resolved, I am more than happy to listen to them.
