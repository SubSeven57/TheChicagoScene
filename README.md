# Introduction

Hello there! :wave:
My name is Daniel Hernandez and I am a developer as we as a musician involved in the Chicago music scene. I wanted to create a repo to keep track of the many musical acts in Chicago. I wanted to do this because:

1. There's a lot of talent that not a lot of people know about.
2. It's kinda cool to see what acts are around (and which ones are not :skull:)
3. It feeds my list-keeping addiction.

If you want to add a band, you can either contact me via email, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AScarletDawn/), or submit an issue.
