**Bio**: Formerly known as Before The Night Ends (BTNE), we were formed on May 15, 2010 with Angel Marcos and Rafael "Ralph" Ortiz (former member). Throughout the years, we went through multiple members and performed at various venues such as: The House of Blues of Chicago, Reggie's Rock Club of Chicago, Mojoes of Joliet, Penny Road Pub of Barrington, IL, Q Bar and Grill of Darien, IL, and various house shows around Illinois.

On May 1st, 2014 we released our EP titled "Before The Night Ends" to the public and getting ready to go back out and perform at more shows around the city.

We love to make music and often experiment with different genres. At the moment we are currently working on our second release.
